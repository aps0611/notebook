# My Notes & Reflections

_This book is a collection of my notes on some topics in deep learning and machine learning. Iâ€™ve put them together mainly for fun and as a way to strengthen my own understanding while revisiting important concepts. I hope they might also serve as a simple and useful resource for anyone who is curious about the subject or just starting out._
